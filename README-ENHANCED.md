## Philosophy Behind the Enhancements

These enhancements are based on research in behavioral psychology, motivation science, and compassion-focused therapy. Key principles include:

- **Progress Over Perfection**: Any forward movement counts
- **Self-Compassion**: Treating yourself with kindness improves motivation more than self-criticism
- **Friction Awareness**: Making desired behaviors as easy as possible
- **Energy Management**: Working with rather than against your current capacity
- **Non-Contingent Growth**: Value that isn't solely dependent on perfect performance
- **Tiny Habits**: Building momentum through extremely small actions

We hope these enhancements make MotivateMe an even more supportive companion when motivation is low. Remember that using the app at all - even just to check in - counts as a meaningful step forward.
